What You Want to Add (New Sales Features):
1. Sell Parts Page
A new page where salespeople can browse parts (like home.html)

Instead of “Use -1”, they click “Add to List” with a quantity

A cart section below shows what’s been added

2. Cart Functionality
Parts added from the “Sell” page go into a cart

The cart stores: part ID, name, quantity, price, subtotal

Stored in session or temporary table per user

3. Checkout Page

Has inputs for:

Buyer name

Buyer phone

Discount input

When confirmed:

Saves order to a sales table

4. Order History Page

Columns: date, receipt number, total, salesperson, buyer

Each row links to order details

5. Sales Report Page (Optional later)

Save order	On submit: insert into orders and order_items tables, update stock levels
